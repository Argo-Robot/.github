As Argo progresses, the need for advanced robotics technologies like manipulation or locomotion becomes critical. To encourage collaboration and innovation, we’ve decided to make key components of our research open-source.

Explore our repositories and deep-dive tutorials:

- [**Footsteps Planning**](https://github.com/Argo-Robot/footsteps_planning): Algorithms for planning footstep trajectories for a biped given a global path.
- [**Locomotion Policy for Quadrupeds**](https://github.com/Argo-Robot/wake_word_detection): Reinforcement learning-based policy for quadrupedal robots, enabling adaptive and smooth motion in Mujoco. 
- [**Locomotion Policy for Bipeds**](https://github.com/Argo-Robot/wake_word_detection): Reinforcement learning-based policy for biped robots, enabling adaptive and smooth motion in Mujoco.
